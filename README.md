# Face-Detection-Using-ML-Kit
To detect and track a face in a picture, we used Firebase ML Kit, a tool that tries to simplify bringing machine learning algorithms to mobile devices. When it comes to face detection and tracking, ML Kit gives us the ability to provide pictures to a FirebaseVisionFaceDetector and then receive callbacks with information about the faces in that picture.
